.SH DESCRIPTION
.B twhich 
searches each transcript listed in the command file ( the default name is
.B command.K )
for
.IR file .
Transcripts are searched in precedence order.
The first
transcript listed in the command file has the lowest precedence, the
next higher, and the last has the highest.  If any special files are
listed, the
.B special.T
transcript will have the absolute highest precedence.
.I file
must be the full decoded path (See
.BR fsdiff (1)),
as listed in the transcript. 

If
.I file
is found,
.B twhich
prints a message to the standard output indicating the transcript, line
number and matching line, and then exits.  With the -a option,
.B twhich
will continue to search all transcripts listed in the command file for
.IR file .
With the -r option,
.B twhich
will search for each path component, progressively building to
.IR file ,
behaving as above when matches are found. If a path element in
.I file
is missing, twhich will print "not found" and continue looking for
the next element. 

The -s option is used to run
.B twhich
on a radmind server.  When run on a server, the command file to search
must be given with the -K option.  All listed transcripts
must be in the respective radmind server transcript directory.
