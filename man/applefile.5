.SH NAME
.B applefile
\- Radmind AppleSingle file
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
To provide support for Mac OS X, radmind is aware of the Mac OS metadata used
on HFS+-formatted drives. When
.B lcreate
uploads a file denoted in the transcript as an
.B applefile
(type 'a'), it encodes the file and the file's metadata to the server as an
AppleSingle file. The AppleSingle file is an archive containing a file's
relevant metadata and data in a single file stream. The radmind AppleSingle
file has the following format:
.sp
1) The AppleSingle header, consisting of a 
4-byte magic number, 4-byte version number, 16-byte filler, 2-byte number 
denoting the number of entries in the archive, and 3 header entries, each
describing the items in the archive and containing a 4-byte entry id, 4-byte
offset, and 4-byte length;
.sp
2) The file's Finder information (32 bytes),
which stores
the file's Type and Creator codes, as well its position in the Finder window;
.sp
3) The file's Resource Fork, which contains things like images, sounds, and
other data not easily or appropriately stored in the Data Fork;
.sp
4) The file's
Data Fork, the portion visible from the Finder, and the only part which is
considered valid by flat file systems.
.sp
The radmind tool
.B lapply
similarly decodes the applefile from the server and restores it to the client
Mac OS X machine running on an HFS+-formatted drive.
