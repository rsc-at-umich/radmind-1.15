.I file 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lfdiff 
retrieves 
.IR file ,
given as an unencoded path,
from the radmind server 
.I host 
and writes it to
/tmp.
.I file
is then compared to the local copy of 
.I file 
using 
.BR diff (1). 
The server copy and the local copy of 
.I file 
are passed to 
.BR diff (1)
as file1
and file2 arguments respectively.  
.I file 
is removed from /tmp on exit.
.B lfdiff
supports all single letter 
.BR diff (1)
options not duplicated in 
.BR lfdiff .
All other
.BR diff (1) 
options are given using the \-X option.

.TP 19
.B \-I
compare paths case-insensitively
.TP 19
.BI \-h\  host
specifies the radmind server, by default
.BR _RADMIND_HOST .

.BI \-p\  port 
specifies the port of the radmind server, by default
.BR 6222 .
.TP 19
.BI \-P\  ca-pem-directory
specifies a directory that contains certificates to be used when verifying the server.  Certificates must be in PEM format and the directory must have been
processed with the openssl c_rehash utility. 
.TP 19
.B \-r
use random seed file $RANDFILE if that environment variable is set,
$HOME/.rnd otherwise.  See
.BR RAND_load_file (3o).
.TP 19
.B \-S
.I file
is a special file.
.TP 19
.BI \-T\  transcript 
transcript that 
.I file 
is listed in.
.TP
.BI \-u\  umask
specifies the umask for temporary files, by default 0077
.TP 19
.B \-V
displays the version of 
.B lfdiff 
and exits.
.TP 19
.BI \-v
display communication with the radmind server.
.TP 19
.BI \-X\  unsupported\ diff\ options
passes options directly to
.BR diff (1). 
.TP 19
.BI \-w\  auth-level
TLS authorization level, by default _RADMIND_AUTHLEVEL.
0 = no TLS, 1 = server verification, 2 = server and client verification.
.TP 19
